# Overview

This is a tower defense game. In order to play, you will need to install pygame and dbmongo.
dbmongo: python -m pip install pymongo
pygame: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
Once you have those setup, click run from the main.py. Once there, you will be given a selection of towers to place. The goal
is to strategically place your towers to destroy the enemy towers before they destroy your base.
